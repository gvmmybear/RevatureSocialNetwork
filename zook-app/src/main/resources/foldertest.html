        I added this file to see if I could access this html page from http://localhost:9039/foldertest.html
        but it looks like it is only able to currently access html files from within the static folder.
        <br>
        I think i will keep this here for now, that way once we start to get servers up and running we can see if
        we can serve html files from within the resources folder, which makes more sense to me.
