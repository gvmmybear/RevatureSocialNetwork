    <p>this is the home page skeleton html file</p>
    <p>if your server is up and running, you can find this page by using: 
        "http://localhost:9039/html/home.html"
    </p>
    <p>
        I imagine once we have some servlet mapping going we wont have to use the /html/home.html thing,
         but this at least gives whoever wants to work on these pages, an easy way to access them through 
         their browser. 
    </p>

    <!-- script src link below will work when server is running on port: 9039 -->
    <script src="http://localhost:9039/javascript/ajaxhome.js"></script>
